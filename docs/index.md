#About 

This site is a compilation of code documentation for diferent coding tasks/snippets. 

The idea behind this is to document any piece of code that is a bit hard to remember. Since my memory is bad, I am going to use this site as a reminder of how to do certain tasks. 

The sources for this site can be found in [Github](https://github.com/misato/random-code-documentation)

Enjoy!
